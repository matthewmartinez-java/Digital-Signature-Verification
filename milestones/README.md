# Milestones Folder

Welcome to the **Milestones Folder** of our Introduction to Databases course. It is organized into five subfolders corresponding to each milestone in this project.

## Usage

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific milestone and contains all the relevant guidelines associated 
with that phase of your database project. This organization ensures that all project artifacts are easily accessible and 
properly archived for future reference.

Please ensure that all documentation is complete, accurate, and adheres to the guidelines provided for each milestone. 
This documentation serves as a critical part of the project and will be used for grading, portfolio development, and future reference.
