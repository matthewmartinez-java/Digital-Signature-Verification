# Milestone 5: Final Project Demo (15 Points)

Welcome to the final milestone of your project and this course! 
You've made it through one of the most challenging classes in the curriculum, and you did it in a condensed **summer semester**. 
That alone is an impressive accomplishment. Milestone 5 is your chance to show off everything youâ€™ve built and reflect on your journey. 
Thank you for your persistence, creativity, and dedication.

## Final Deliverable: 15-Minute Video Demo

Your task is to create a **15-minute recorded video** where you walk through your entire project. Treat it like a portfolio presentation; clear, organized, and confident.

### What to Include in the Video

Your recording must include the following sections:

1. **Project Purpose & Unique Features**  
   - Explain what your project does and why it matters.  
   - Highlight features you built that go beyond the basics and explain why theyâ€™re unique.

2. **ERD Explanation**  
   - Walk through your conceptual design (ERD).  
   - Describe the most important relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and how they influence your models.

3. **Business Requirements & Tradeoffs**  
   - Describe the business requirements you implemented.  
   - Discuss any tradeoffs involved â€” for example, how things might differ if implemented using raw SQL or another ORM.

4. **Live Demo of Your ORM**  
   - Demonstrate how your ORM works using your most important models.  
   - Show how developers can use your ORM without needing to write raw SQL.  
   - Talk about why this is better (or worse) than writing raw queries directly.

5. **Final Reflection**  
   - Reflect on mistakes made along the way.  
   - Share what youâ€™d do differently if you were to start the project over.  
   - Offer any closing thoughts on what you learned.

## Final Words

This is the final milestone of the course, and youâ€™ve made it to the end of a fast-paced, intensive summer class. 
Whether you're proud of every feature or frustrated by bugs you didnâ€™t squash, remember: building something from scratch is hard. 
You've done real work here, and gained a deeper understanding of databases, design, abstraction, and development.

Thank you again for your effort and energy this semester. I hope you leave this course more confident in your skills and proud of what youâ€™ve built.

Wishing you all the best moving forward!

â€” **Prof. Jose Ortiz**
