## TODO

Please complete the following tasks by the end of the **first Friday of the semester**. Students who miss this deadline may be dropped from the course to make space for others on the waitlist.

- Fill in your name and SFSU email in the table below.
- Choose a topic for your database system project. **Once selected, it cannot be changed.** You can browse potential ideas in [Database Topics](milestones/res/TOPICS.md). If you're still unsure after reviewing the list, reach out to the instructor for help.
- Add your name to the copyright notice at the bottom of this page.

## Repository Content

All work in this repository is divided into five milestones, which together count for 75% of your final grade.

| Milestone | Description                               | Weight | Extra Credit Opportunities                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Database Requirements & Conceptual Design | 15%    | 2% for creating an excellent ERD implementation          |
| 2         | DB Normalization and Schema               | 15%    | 1% for correctly applying 4NF normalization              |
| 3         | Business Requirements and Implementation  | 15%    | 2% for implementing solutions at an industry-grade level |
| 4         | Object Relational Mapping (ORM)           | 15%    | 2% for correctly implementing versioned migrations       |
| 5         | Testing, Performance Analysis and Demo    | 15%    | 3% for presenting your work in class                     |

**Note:** AI tools may assist with some tasks, but the goal of this course is to help you build your own skills. Your submissions should reflect your personal understanding and effort. Overreliance on external tools can limit your growth and impact your long-term success.

## Submission and Grading Policies

Each milestone has its own submission and grading instructions located in the corresponding milestone's README file. These will be followed strictly during grading. Make sure to review them as soon as a milestone is assigned.

Here are the general policies for all milestone submissions (also detailed in the syllabus):

> All work must be committed to the `master` branch of your assigned GitHub repository. Only the `master` branch will be graded. No exceptions!

- All milestones must be submitted via pull requests to your assigned repository.
- Assignments must be submitted both to Canvas and the class GitHub repository to be considered for grading.
- Due dates are final; it is your responsibility to keep track of them and plan accordingly.
- Make-up milestones will only be considered in cases of serious emergencies or DPRC-approved accommodations. Official documentation is required.
- You are responsible for your submission. If you submit a blank file or broken link, that is what will be graded. Always double-check your work.
- Late submissions will not be accepted unless you have DPRC accommodations.
- Work submitted to personal GitHub accounts will not be graded. You must use the official course repository created through the instructor's link.
- **AI Usage Policy:** Use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor. Unauthorized use will be treated as a policy violation.

## Grade Appeal

- You may request a grade revision up to one week after your milestone grade is posted on Canvas.
- To appeal, (1) schedule office hours with the instructor, and (2) clearly show where points were deducted in error.
- After one week, all grades are final and will not be changed under any circumstances.

> **Reminder:** Putting in the effort now means less stress later. Plus, you'll be proud of what you build! ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž  
> This project can serve as a portfolio pieceâ€”do your own work, learn deeply, and showcase your skills with confidence.
